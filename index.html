        <h1>The Legend of Zelda</h1>

        <p><strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong> is a fantasy themed action-adventure series created by Japanese game designers <em>Shigeru Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka and Eiji Aonuma</em>. It was developed and published by <strong>Nintendo</strong> and is considered one of Nintendo's most important and popular franchises. Its gameplay consists of a mixture of action, adventure, and puzzle solving.</p>
        
        <p>The series centers primarily on <em>Link</em>, the playable character. Link is often tasked with rescuing <em>Princess Zelda</em> and the <em>Kingdom of Hyrule</em> from <em>Ganondorf</em>, an evil thief who is the primary antagonist of the series. The story commonly involves a relic known as the <strong>Triforce</strong>, a set of three mystical golden triangles.</p>

        <p>In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-playable characters.Link is described as humble, hardworking and brave, and therefore appropriate to bear the <strong>Triforce of Courage</strong>. The various Links each have a special title, such as <em>Hero of Time</em>, <em>Hero of the Winds</em> or <em>Hero chosen by the gods</em>. Link is left-handed, with two exceptions. In the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Link is right-handed due to the <em>mirroring</em> used to accommodate the right-handed control scheme, which flips the entire game world's layout from that of its Nintendo GameCube counterpart. Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, or similar sounds. Despite the player not seeing the dialogue, it is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, showing that he is not, in fact, mute. Link is shown as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.</p>
        
        <p>There has been a total of 16 different Zelda titles on 15 different Nintendo consloles from 1986 to present day.</p>
